# Evidence-Based Analysis

Support all claims with concrete evidence. No assumptions or speculation.

## Evidence Format

Every claim requires:
- File reference: `[filename.php:line]`
- Code snippet from implementation
- Context if needed

## Hypothesis vs Fact

### Unverified Claims
- Label as "Hypothesis - needs verification"
- Propose investigation steps
- **Do NOT implement until verified**

### Forbidden Phrases
- "probably", "possibly", "might be", "could be", "I think", "maybe"

### Required Format
```
Issue in [class-mase-admin.php:142]: <code snippet>
Test output: <actual result>
Console error: <exact message>
Hypothesis: X causes Y - verify by checking Z in [file:line]
```

## Verification Methods

1. Read source code directly
2. Run tests and examine output
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Review WordPress debug logs (`WP_DEBUG`)
5. Use `grep` to search patterns

## Workflow

1. State investigation target
2. Show evidence from code/tests/logs
3. Draw conclusions from evidence only
4. If insufficient evidence, state what's needed
5. Implement only after root cause confirmed
