# Evidence-Based Analysis

Every claim must be supported by concrete evidence. No assumptions or speculation.

## Evidence Requirements

**Every claim needs:**
- File reference: `[filename.php:line]`
- Code snippet from actual implementation
- Context when relevant

**Example:**
```
Issue in [class-mase-admin.php:142]:
public function handle_apply_template() {
    // Missing nonce verification
}
```

## Hypothesis vs Fact

**Unverified claims:**
- Label explicitly: "Hypothesis - needs verification"
- Propose investigation steps
- **NEVER implement until verified**

**Forbidden phrases:**
- "probably", "possibly", "might be", "could be", "I think", "maybe"

**Required format:**
```
Issue: [class-mase-admin.php:142] - <code snippet>
Evidence: Test output shows <actual result>
Console: <exact error message>
Hypothesis: X causes Y - verify by checking [file.php:line]
```

## Verification Methods

1. Read source code with file tools
2. Run tests and capture output
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Review WordPress debug logs (WP_DEBUG)
5. Use `grepSearch` to find patterns across codebase

## Analysis Workflow

1. State investigation target clearly
2. Gather evidence from code/tests/logs
3. Draw conclusions ONLY from evidence
4. If evidence insufficient, specify what's needed
5. Implement ONLY after root cause confirmed with evidence
