# Incremental Analysis

Investigate layer by layer. Complete understanding before implementing.

## Analysis Sequence

Debug in this order:

1. **PHP Layer** - Asset enqueuing, AJAX handlers, nonces, capabilities
2. **JavaScript Layer** - Event bindings, AJAX calls, initialization order
3. **HTML/CSS Layer** - DOM structure, selectors, visibility, z-index
4. **Tests** - Run tests to verify and reproduce
5. **Synthesis** - Combine findings to identify root cause

## Rules

**Do NOT:**
- Jump to conclusions after one file
- Skip sequence steps
- Implement before understanding root cause
- Assume first issue is the only issue

**DO:**
- Build knowledge incrementally
- Document findings at each step
- Verify assumptions before proceeding
- Complete analysis before proposing solutions

## Example: Button Click Not Working

**PHP Layer:**
- JS enqueued in `MASE_Admin::enqueue_admin_assets()`?
- Nonce passed via `wp_localize_script()`?
- AJAX handler registered with `add_action('wp_ajax_...')`?

**JavaScript Layer:**
- Event listener on correct selector?
- AJAX call fires? (Network tab)
- JavaScript errors? (Console)

**HTML/CSS Layer:**
- Button visible in DOM?
- Computed styles: `pointer-events`, `display`, `visibility`
- Z-index conflicts or overlapping elements?

**Tests:**
- Test suite reproduces issue?
- What do results show?

**Synthesis:**
- Combine evidence from all layers
- Identify root cause with `[file:line]` references
- Propose targeted fix
