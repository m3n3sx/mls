# Solution Strategy

Always provide both immediate and long-term solutions.

## Immediate Fix

**Criteria:**
- Time: < 30 minutes
- Files: â‰¤ 3
- No breaking changes
- Browser verifiable
- Minimal risk

**Approach:**
1. Identify minimal change point
2. Apply targeted fix (comment conflict, adjust selector, add CSS)
3. Verify in browser
4. Run tests for regressions

**Example:**
```php
// Immediate: Comment out duplicate handler
// add_action('wp_ajax_mase_apply_template', [$this, 'handle_apply_template']);
```

## Long-Term Fix

**Criteria:**
- Architectural improvement
- Full refactoring
- Time: 1-2 weeks
- Comprehensive testing
- Addresses root cause

**Approach:**
1. Document architecture issues with evidence (`[file:line]`)
2. Propose refactored structure with benefits
3. Create migration plan with rollback strategy
4. Implement with full test coverage
5. Update documentation

**Example:**
```
Long-term: Consolidate duplicate AJAX handlers into registry
pattern in MASE_Admin with centralized routing and nonce verification.
Benefits: Single source of truth, easier testing, no conflicts.
```

## Decision Guide

**Use Immediate Fix when:**
- Production issue needs quick resolution
- User blocked from critical functionality
- Side effect risk is low
- Long-term fix requires planning/discussion

**Use Long-Term Fix when:**
- Technical debt is accumulating
- Issue repeats frequently
- Architectural improvements needed
- Time available for proper implementation

## Required Format

Always present solutions in this order:

1. **Immediate Fix** - Unblock now (< 30 min)
2. **Long-Term Fix** - Proper resolution (1-2 weeks)
3. **Recommendation** - Which to use based on context and urgency
