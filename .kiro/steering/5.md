# Practical Solutions

Provide both immediate and long-term solutions for issues.

## Immediate Fix

**Criteria:**
- Time: < 30 minutes
- Files: â‰¤ 3
- No breaking changes
- Browser verifiable
- Minimal risk

**Approach:**
1. Identify minimal change point
2. Apply targeted fix (comment conflict, adjust selector, add CSS)
3. Verify in browser
4. Run tests for regressions

**Example:**
```php
// Immediate: Comment out duplicate handler
// add_action('wp_ajax_mase_apply_template', [$this, 'handle_apply_template']);
```

## Long-Term Fix

**Criteria:**
- Architectural improvement
- Full refactoring
- Time: 1-2 weeks
- Comprehensive testing
- Addresses root cause

**Approach:**
1. Document architecture issues with evidence
2. Propose refactored structure with benefits
3. Create migration plan with rollback
4. Implement with test coverage
5. Update documentation

**Example:**
```
Long-term: Consolidate duplicate AJAX handlers into registry
pattern in MASE_Admin with centralized routing and nonce verification.
```

## Decision Guide

**Use Immediate Fix:**
- Production issue needing quick resolution
- User blocked from critical functionality
- Low side effect risk
- Long-term fix needs planning

**Use Long-Term Fix:**
- Technical debt accumulating
- Issue repeats frequently
- Architectural improvements needed
- Time available for proper implementation
