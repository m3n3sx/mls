# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for modernizing the Modern Admin Styler (MASE) plugin architecture from a monolithic 3000+ line JavaScript file to a modular, scalable, and maintainable system. The refactoring will introduce modern JavaScript tooling, clear separation of concerns, and a foundation for advanced features while maintaining backwards compatibility and current functionality.
