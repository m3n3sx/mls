# Requirements Document - Live Preview Toggle Fix

## Introduction

This document specifies requirements for fixing the Live Preview toggle functionality in the Modern Admin Styler Enterprise (MASE) WordPress plugin. The toggle is currently non-functional due to dashicons intercepting pointer events, preventing both user clicks and automated test interactions.

## Glossary

- **MASE**: Modern Admin Styler Enterprise - WordPress admin styling plugin
- **Live Preview Toggle**: Checkbox control in header that enables/disables real-time preview of style changes
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Checkbox control in header that enables/disables dark theme
- **Dashicons**: WordPress icon font used for UI elements
- **Pointer Events**: CSS property that controls whether an element can be the target of mouse/touch events
- **WordPress Color Picker (Iris)**: WordPress built-in color picker component
- **Playwright**: Automated browser testing framework
- **ARIA**: Accessible Rich Internet Applications - accessibility standard

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Dashicons Pointer Events Blocking

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click on toggle switches in the header, so that I can enable/disable features like Live Preview and Dark Mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on the Live Preview toggle label area, THE System SHALL toggle the checkbox state
2. WHEN a user clicks on the Dark Mode toggle label area, THE System SHALL toggle the checkbox state
3. WHEN a dashicon is positioned over a checkbox, THE System SHALL allow click events to pass through to the underlying checkbox
4. WHERE automated tests interact with toggle checkboxes, THE System SHALL allow programmatic clicks to reach the checkbox element
5. WHILE dashicons are visible in toggle controls, THE System SHALL maintain visual appearance without blocking interactions

### Requirement 2: Fix WordPress Color Picker Accessibility

**User Story:** As an automated test, I want to interact with color picker inputs, so that I can verify color customization functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WordPress Color Picker initializes, THE System SHALL create accessible fallback inputs for each color picker
2. WHEN a fallback input value changes, THE System SHALL synchronize the value with the WordPress Color Picker
3. WHEN the WordPress Color Picker value changes, THE System SHALL synchronize the value with the fallback input
4. WHERE automated tests need to set color values, THE System SHALL provide visible and editable fallback inputs
5. WHILE fallback inputs exist, THE System SHALL position them off-screen to hide from visual users

### Requirement 3: Fix Template Apply Button Visibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see and click template apply buttons, so that I can apply pre-configured templates to my admin interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Templates tab is active, THE System SHALL display all template apply buttons as visible
2. WHEN a template card is in the viewport, THE System SHALL ensure the apply button is not hidden by CSS
3. WHERE template buttons are in inactive tabs, THE System SHALL make them visible when the tab becomes active
4. WHILE a user navigates to the Templates tab, THE System SHALL ensure all template buttons are clickable
5. IF a template button is clicked, THEN THE System SHALL execute the template application handler

### Requirement 4: Verify CSS Pointer Events Fix

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that CSS fixes are properly applied, so that I can ensure the solution works across all browsers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin page loads, THE System SHALL apply pointer-events: none to all dashicons within toggle contexts
2. WHEN inline styles are injected, THE System SHALL include the dashicon pointer-events fix
3. WHERE CSS files are enqueued, THE System SHALL ensure the fix is present in mase-admin.css
4. WHILE the page is rendered, THE System SHALL verify no conflicting CSS rules override the pointer-events fix
5. IF multiple CSS sources exist, THEN THE System SHALL ensure the fix has sufficient specificity to take precedence

### Requirement 5: Improve Event Handler Robustness

**User Story:** As a developer, I want event handlers to be resilient to edge cases, so that the application doesn't break under unexpected conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an event handler receives an invalid event object, THE System SHALL log a warning and return early
2. WHEN an event handler accesses event properties, THE System SHALL verify the property exists before accessing
3. WHERE event handlers bind to elements, THE System SHALL verify elements exist before binding
4. WHILE processing events, THE System SHALL wrap operations in try-catch blocks to prevent crashes
5. IF an error occurs in an event handler, THEN THE System SHALL log the error with stack trace and continue execution

### Requirement 6: Ensure Tab Navigation Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want tab navigation to work correctly, so that I can access all settings sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a tab button, THE System SHALL show the corresponding tab content
2. WHEN a tab becomes active, THE System SHALL ensure all interactive elements within are accessible
3. WHERE elements are hidden in inactive tabs, THE System SHALL make them visible when the tab activates
4. WHILE switching tabs, THE System SHALL maintain focus management for accessibility
5. IF a tab contains forms or buttons, THEN THE System SHALL ensure they are fully functional when the tab is active

### Requirement 7: Validate Automated Test Compatibility

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want automated tests to pass reliably, so that I can verify functionality without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Playwright tests run, THE System SHALL allow tests to click on toggle checkboxes
2. WHEN Playwright tests run, THE System SHALL allow tests to fill color picker inputs
3. WHEN Playwright tests run, THE System SHALL allow tests to click template apply buttons
4. WHERE tests verify element visibility, THE System SHALL ensure elements are not hidden by CSS
5. WHILE tests interact with forms, THE System SHALL ensure all form controls are accessible to automation tools

## Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing WordPress admin themes
- Must not break existing user workflows or saved settings
- Must follow WordPress coding standards and best practices
- Must maintain accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)
- Must work across all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Must not introduce performance regressions
- Must preserve existing visual design and user experience

## Success Criteria

- All 55 automated tests pass (currently 41/55 passing)
- Live Preview toggle responds to clicks within 100ms
- Dark Mode toggle responds to clicks within 100ms
- Color pickers are editable by automated tests
- Template apply buttons are clickable in all tabs
- No console errors or warnings during normal operation
- Accessibility audit shows no regressions
