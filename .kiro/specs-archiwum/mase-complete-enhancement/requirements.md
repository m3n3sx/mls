# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the complete enhancement of the Modern Admin Styler Enterprise (MASE) WordPress plugin. The system addresses critical issues with settings persistence, live preview functionality, and implements missing features including Content Tab styling, Universal Button system, enhanced CSS generation, and comprehensive debugging tools. The enhancement ensures all plugin features work reliably with proper validation, real-time preview capabilities, and maintainable code architecture.
