- **Dark Mode**: Alternative color scheme with dark backgrounds and light text
- **Admin Bar**: Top horizontal bar in WordPress admin (32px height by default)
- **Admin Menu**: Left sidebar navigation menu in WordPress admin
- **Slider Control**: Range input element for numeric value selection
- **Track**: Visual rail/background of a slider control
- **Thumb**: Draggable handle on a slider control
- **Glassmorphism**: Visual effect with backdrop blur and transparency
- **WordPress Defaults**: Original WordPress admin styling before MASE customization
- **Scroll Jump**: Unwanted page repositioning during page load or interaction
- **Focus Ring**: Visual indicator showing keyboard focus (blue outline)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Settings Save Functionality

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want to save my MASE settings reliably, so that my customizations persist across sessions without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE System receives a settings save request, THE System SHALL collect all form field values including text inputs, checkboxes, color pickers, range sliders, and select dropdowns
2. WHEN THE System collects form data, THE System SHALL serialize the data into a valid JSON structure matching the expected settings schema
3. WHEN THE System sends the AJAX save request, THE System SHALL include a valid WordPress nonce for security verification
4. IF THE server returns an error response, THEN THE System SHALL display the specific error message to the user in a dismissible notice
5. WHEN THE save operation completes successfully, THE System SHALL display a success message and update the UI state to reflect saved changes

### Requirement 2: Admin Menu Height Mode

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want the "Fit to Content" menu height option to work correctly, so that my admin menu adjusts to the actual content height instead of remaining at 100%.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE user selects "Fit to Content" from the height mode dropdown, THE System SHALL generate CSS that sets admin menu height to auto
2. WHEN THE "Fit to Content" mode is active, THE System SHALL remove any height: 100% declarations from #adminmenuwrap and #adminmenuback elements
3. WHEN THE "Fit to Content" mode is active, THE System SHALL apply min-height constraints to prevent menu collapse
4. WHEN THE user switches between "Full Height" and "Fit to Content", THE System SHALL update the live preview immediately if live preview is enabled
5. WHEN THE settings are saved with "Fit to Content" mode, THE System SHALL persist this setting and apply it on subsequent page loads

### Requirement 3: Slider Visual Rendering

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want slider controls to display properly with visible track and thumb, so that I can adjust numeric values using the visual slider interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL render range input elements with a visible horizontal track spanning the full width of the control container
2. THE System SHALL render a draggable thumb element on each slider that is visually distinct from the track
3. WHEN THE user hovers over a slider thumb, THE System SHALL apply hover state styling to provide visual feedback
4. WHEN THE user drags a slider thumb, THE System SHALL update the displayed value in real-time adjacent to the slider
5. THE System SHALL style slider tracks with appropriate background color, height, and border radius for visual consistency

### Requirement 4: Default Menu Spacing

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want the default admin menu to display with correct spacing, so that menu items are readable and properly sized without appearing compressed or oversized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE System applies default menu styling, THE System SHALL use WordPress standard padding values for menu items
2. WHEN THE System applies default menu styling, THE System SHALL use WordPress standard font size of 13px for menu text
3. WHEN THE System applies default menu styling, THE System SHALL use WordPress standard line height of 18px for menu items
4. THE System SHALL apply consistent vertical spacing between menu items matching WordPress defaults
5. THE System SHALL ensure submenu items have appropriate indentation and padding relative to parent items

### Requirement 5: Reset to WordPress Defaults

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want the Reset button to restore all WordPress default styles, so that I can return to the original admin appearance without MASE customizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE user clicks the "Reset All" button, THE System SHALL display a confirmation dialog warning that all customizations will be lost
2. IF THE user confirms the reset action, THEN THE System SHALL remove all injected style elements from the document head
3. WHEN THE reset operation executes, THE System SHALL clear all live preview CSS from the page
4. WHEN THE reset operation executes, THE System SHALL send an AJAX request to delete all MASE settings from the database
5. WHEN THE reset completes successfully, THE System SHALL reload the page to display WordPress default admin styling

### Requirement 6: Dark Mode Synchronization

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want dark mode to synchronize correctly between the header toggle and settings form, so that enabling dark mode in one location updates all related controls consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE user toggles the dark mode switch in the header, THE System SHALL update the dark mode checkbox in the General tab Master Controls section
2. WHEN THE user toggles the dark mode checkbox in Master Controls, THE System SHALL update the header dark mode switch
3. WHEN THE dark mode state changes, THE System SHALL apply the data-theme="dark" attribute to the document root element
4. WHEN THE dark mode state changes, THE System SHALL update all CSS custom properties to use dark mode color values
5. WHEN THE page loads with dark mode enabled in saved settings, THE System SHALL initialize both toggle controls to the checked state

### Requirement 7: Scroll Position Stability

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want the page scroll position to remain stable during page load and interactions, so that I don't experience disorienting jumps or unwanted repositioning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE page loads, THE System SHALL prevent automatic scrolling or focus changes that alter the viewport position
2. WHEN THE System initializes form controls, THE System SHALL avoid triggering focus events that cause scroll jumps
3. WHEN THE user interacts with form controls, THE System SHALL remove visible focus rings (blue outlines) after interaction completes
4. WHEN THE System applies live preview updates, THE System SHALL maintain the current scroll position
5. THE System SHALL use CSS outline: none on interactive elements to prevent blue focus rings while maintaining keyboard accessibility through alternative focus indicators

### Requirement 8: Admin Bar Position Stability

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want the admin bar to remain in its correct position during page refresh, so that the layout doesn't shift or jump when the page reloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE page loads, THE System SHALL apply admin bar styles before the browser renders the page to prevent layout shift
2. WHEN THE System applies admin bar customizations, THE System SHALL maintain the fixed positioning at top: 0
3. WHEN THE System applies glassmorphism or floating effects to the admin bar, THE System SHALL account for these in the positioning calculations
4. WHEN THE page refreshes, THE System SHALL prevent the admin bar from temporarily appearing in the wrong position
5. THE System SHALL ensure admin bar z-index values prevent content from overlapping during page load transitions
