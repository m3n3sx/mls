6. WHEN the login page renders, THE MASE Plugin SHALL apply the configured background styling via dynamically generated CSS

### Requirement 3: Login Form Visual Styling

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want to customize the appearance of the login form, so that it integrates seamlessly with my custom background and branding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator selects form colors, THE MASE Plugin SHALL apply custom values for background, border, text, and focus states
2. WHEN the administrator adjusts the border radius slider, THE MASE Plugin SHALL apply values between 0 and 25 pixels to the form container

4. WHEN the administrator enables glassmorphism effect, THE MASE Plugin SHALL apply backdrop blur and transparency to create the frosted glass appearance
5. WHEN the administrator customizes typography settings, THE MASE Plugin SHALL apply font family, size, and weight to form labels and input fields
6. WHEN the login page renders, THE MASE Plugin SHALL generate and inject CSS containing all form styling customizations

### Requirement 4: Additional Branding Elements

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want to add custom footer text and hide default WordPress branding, so that the login page reflects only my organization's identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator enters custom footer text, THE MASE Plugin SHALL sanitize the input and display it in the login page footer
2. WHEN the administrator enables the "hide WordPress branding" option, THE MASE Plugin SHALL use CSS to hide the "Powered by WordPress" text
3. WHEN the administrator provides custom CSS code, THE MASE Plugin SHALL sanitize and inject it into the login page stylesheet
4. WHEN the administrator customizes the "Remember Me" checkbox styling, THE MASE Plugin SHALL apply the custom appearance via CSS
5. WHEN custom footer text contains HTML, THE MASE Plugin SHALL escape all output to prevent XSS vulnerabilities

### Requirement 5: Settings Management and Persistence

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want my login page customizations to be saved and applied consistently, so that the custom appearance persists across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator saves login customization settings, THE MASE Plugin SHALL validate all input fields before storing in the WordPress options table
2. WHEN settings validation fails, THE MASE Plugin SHALL display specific error messages indicating which fields require correction
3. WHEN the login page loads, THE MASE Plugin SHALL retrieve stored customization settings from the database
4. WHEN settings are updated, THE MASE Plugin SHALL clear any cached CSS to ensure changes appear immediately
5. WHEN the plugin is deactivated, THE MASE Plugin SHALL retain all login customization settings for future reactivation

### Requirement 6: Security and File Upload Validation

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want file uploads to be thoroughly validated, so that malicious files cannot compromise site security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is uploaded, THE MASE Plugin SHALL verify the file extension matches allowed types (PNG, JPG, SVG)
2. WHEN a file is uploaded, THE MASE Plugin SHALL verify the MIME type matches the file extension
3. WHEN a file is uploaded, THE MASE Plugin SHALL verify the file size does not exceed configured limits (2MB for logos, 5MB for backgrounds)
4. WHEN an SVG file is uploaded, THE MASE Plugin SHALL parse the XML content and remove script elements, event attributes, and external entity references
5. WHEN a file upload fails validation, THE MASE Plugin SHALL return a specific error message and reject the upload
6. WHEN processing AJAX upload requests, THE MASE Plugin SHALL verify the WordPress nonce and user capabilities before accepting files

### Requirement 7: Admin Interface Integration

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want login customization options integrated into the MASE settings interface, so that I can manage all styling from one location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. WHEN the administrator adjusts sliders or color pickers, THE MASE Plugin SHALL provide real-time visual feedback where technically feasible
5. WHEN the administrator saves settings, THE MASE Plugin SHALL display a success message confirming the changes were stored

### Requirement 8: CSS Generation and Injection

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want my customizations to be applied efficiently, so that the login page loads quickly without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the login page loads, THE MASE Plugin SHALL hook into the login_enqueue_scripts action to inject custom CSS
2. WHEN generating login page CSS, THE MASE Plugin SHALL use the existing CSS Generator component (class-mase-css-generator.php)
3. WHEN custom CSS is generated, THE MASE Plugin SHALL minify the output to reduce file size
4. WHEN settings have not changed, THE MASE Plugin SHALL serve cached CSS instead of regenerating
5. WHEN the login page renders, THE MASE Plugin SHALL ensure custom styles load after WordPress default styles to maintain proper cascade priority

### Requirement 9: Backward Compatibility and Migration

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator upgrading MASE, I want existing settings to remain intact, so that my current customizations continue working without manual reconfiguration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin is updated, THE MASE Plugin SHALL preserve all existing login customization settings
2. WHEN new settings fields are added, THE MASE Plugin SHALL provide sensible default values that do not alter existing appearance
3. WHEN the settings structure changes, THE MASE Plugin SHALL migrate old format data to the new structure automatically
4. WHEN migration occurs, THE MASE Plugin SHALL log the process for debugging purposes
5. WHEN migration fails, THE MASE Plugin SHALL maintain the old settings format and display an admin notice

### Requirement 10: Accessibility and Standards Compliance

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want login page customizations to meet accessibility standards, so that all users can authenticate regardless of abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN custom colors are applied, THE MASE Plugin SHALL validate that text and background combinations meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratio requirements (4.5:1 for normal text)
2. WHEN contrast validation fails, THE MASE Plugin SHALL display a warning message to the administrator
3. WHEN the login form is rendered, THE MASE Plugin SHALL ensure all interactive elements remain keyboard accessible
4. WHEN custom CSS is injected, THE MASE Plugin SHALL not override focus indicators or screen reader text
5. WHEN glassmorphism effects are applied, THE MASE Plugin SHALL ensure form text remains readable with sufficient contrast
