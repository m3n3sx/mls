# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Advanced Background System extends the Modern Admin Styler (MASE) plugin to provide comprehensive background customization capabilities for six distinct WordPress admin areas. The system supports three background types (images, gradients, and patterns) with advanced styling controls including opacity, blend modes, positioning, and responsive variations. The implementation leverages existing MASE infrastructure for file uploads, CSS generation, settings management, and validation while maintaining performance through lazy loading and optimized delivery.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want to upload custom background images for different admin areas, so that I can create a personalized admin interface that matches my brand identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator selects an image file (JPG, PNG, WebP, or SVG) under 5MB, THE Background System SHALL accept the upload and store the file in the WordPress media library.

2. IF the uploaded image width exceeds 1920 pixels, THEN THE Background System SHALL automatically resize the image to 1920 pixels width while maintaining aspect ratio.

3. WHERE the administrator uploads a background image, THE Background System SHALL provide controls for position (center, top, bottom, left, right, custom percentage), size (cover, contain, auto, custom), repeat (no-repeat, repeat, repeat-x, repeat-y), and attachment (scroll, fixed).

4. THE Background System SHALL validate uploaded files to ensure they match allowed MIME types (image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp, image/svg+xml) and reject files exceeding 5MB.

5. WHEN the administrator uploads a background image, THE Background System SHALL generate a thumbnail preview within 2 seconds for visual confirmation.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want to create gradient backgrounds using a visual builder, so that I can design modern, colorful backgrounds without writing CSS code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Background System SHALL provide a gradient builder interface supporting linear gradients (0-360 degrees) and radial gradients (circle, ellipse).

2. WHEN the administrator adds a color stop to a gradient, THE Background System SHALL allow positioning the stop at any percentage from 0% to 100% along the gradient axis.

3. THE Background System SHALL include a preset library containing at least 20 pre-designed gradient options that the administrator can apply with one click.

4. WHEN the administrator modifies gradient parameters, THE Background System SHALL update the live preview within 500 milliseconds to show the changes.

5. THE Background System SHALL support gradients with a minimum of 2 color stops and a maximum of 10 color stops.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want to apply SVG patterns as backgrounds, so that I can add subtle textures and visual interest to admin areas without using large image files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Background System SHALL provide a pattern library containing at least 50 SVG patterns organized into categories (dots, lines, grids, organic shapes).

2. WHERE the administrator selects a pattern, THE Background System SHALL provide controls for pattern color, opacity (0-100%), and scale (50-200%).

3. THE Background System SHALL render pattern backgrounds using inline SVG or data URIs to minimize HTTP requests.

4. WHEN the administrator applies a pattern background, THE Background System SHALL generate CSS that maintains pattern quality at all screen resolutions.

5. THE Background System SHALL allow the administrator to preview all patterns in the library with a single click per pattern.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want to customize backgrounds for six specific admin areas independently, so that I can create visual hierarchy and improve usability across different sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Background System SHALL support independent background configuration for Dashboard Main Area (#wpbody-content), Admin Menu Area (#adminmenu), Post/Page Lists (.wp-list-table), Post Editor (#post-body), Widget Areas (.postbox), and Login Page (body.login).

2. WHEN the administrator configures a background for one admin area, THE Background System SHALL not affect backgrounds in other admin areas unless explicitly configured.

3. THE Background System SHALL provide a navigation interface allowing the administrator to switch between admin area configurations within 2 clicks.

4. THE Background System SHALL persist background settings independently for each admin area in the WordPress database.

5. WHEN the administrator views an admin area, THE Background System SHALL apply only the background configuration specific to that area within 100 milliseconds of page load.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want to control advanced background properties like opacity and blend modes, so that I can create sophisticated visual effects that integrate with existing admin styles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE the administrator configures any background type, THE Background System SHALL provide an opacity control ranging from 0% (fully transparent) to 100% (fully opaque) in 1% increments.

2. THE Background System SHALL support CSS blend modes including normal, overlay, multiply, screen, darken, lighten, color-dodge, color-burn, hard-light, soft-light, difference, exclusion, hue, saturation, color, and luminosity.

3. WHEN the administrator adjusts opacity or blend mode, THE Background System SHALL update the live preview within 500 milliseconds showing the visual effect.

4. THE Background System SHALL apply opacity and blend mode settings without affecting the opacity or blend mode of foreground content (text, buttons, forms).

5. IF the administrator's browser does not support a selected blend mode, THEN THE Background System SHALL gracefully degrade to normal blend mode without breaking the layout.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want to set different backgrounds for desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes, so that I can optimize the visual experience for users on different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE the administrator enables responsive variations, THE Background System SHALL provide separate background configurations for desktop (â‰¥1024px), tablet (768px-1023px), and mobile (<768px) breakpoints.
