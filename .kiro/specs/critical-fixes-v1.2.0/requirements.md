# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical functionality issues in WOOW-ADMIN v1.2.0 that prevent core features from working properly. The plugin currently has four major problems: non-functional live preview, broken card-based layout system, missing dark mode implementation, and incorrect HTML element IDs. These issues must be resolved to deliver a functional admin styling plugin to users.

## Glossary

- **MASE**: Modern Admin Styler Engine - the core system name for the plugin
- **Live Preview System**: Real-time visual feedback mechanism that applies style changes without page reload
- **Dark Mode**: Alternative color scheme with dark backgrounds and light text
- **Card Layout System**: Modern UI pattern using card-based containers for settings groups
- **Admin Settings Page**: WordPress admin interface where users configure plugin settings
- **JavaScript Handler**: Client-side code that manages user interactions and AJAX communications
- **CSS Variables**: Custom properties in CSS that enable dynamic theming
- **Toggle Control**: Checkbox input that enables/disables a feature

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want the live preview toggle to work immediately when I check it, so that I can see my styling changes in real-time without saving.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator clicks the live preview checkbox, THE Live Preview System SHALL enable real-time style updates within 100 milliseconds
2. WHILE live preview is enabled, THE Live Preview System SHALL apply all form changes to the current page within 300 milliseconds of user input
3. WHEN the administrator changes any color picker value, THE Live Preview System SHALL update the corresponding CSS variable immediately
4. WHEN the administrator adjusts any slider control, THE Live Preview System SHALL reflect the new value in the admin interface within 300 milliseconds
5. THE JavaScript Handler SHALL log all live preview state changes to the browser console for debugging purposes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want the settings page to display in a modern card-based layout, so that I can easily navigate and understand different setting groups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Admin Settings Page SHALL render all settings within card containers with class "mase-section-card"
2. THE Admin Settings Page SHALL NOT use HTML table elements for layout structure
3. WHEN the page loads, THE Admin Settings Page SHALL display settings grouped by logical sections within separate cards
4. THE Card Layout System SHALL apply consistent spacing of 20 pixels between cards
5. THE Card Layout System SHALL render setting rows with labels on the left and controls on the right on desktop viewports

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want to enable dark mode for the admin interface, so that I can reduce eye strain during extended work sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator toggles the dark mode checkbox, THE Dark Mode System SHALL apply dark theme CSS variables within 100 milliseconds
2. THE Dark Mode System SHALL persist the user's theme preference in browser localStorage
3. WHEN the page loads, THE Dark Mode System SHALL restore the previously selected theme from localStorage
4. THE Dark Mode System SHALL define complete CSS variable sets for both light and dark themes
5. WHILE dark mode is active, THE Dark Mode System SHALL apply appropriate contrast ratios meeting WCAG AA standards

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all HTML element IDs to match their corresponding JavaScript selectors, so that event handlers bind correctly and features work as designed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Admin Settings Page SHALL assign the ID "mase-live-preview-toggle" to the live preview checkbox element
2. THE Admin Settings Page SHALL assign the ID "master-dark-mode" to the dark mode checkbox element
3. THE JavaScript Handler SHALL successfully bind event listeners to all toggle controls on page load
4. WHEN the page loads, THE JavaScript Handler SHALL log successful initialization to the browser console
5. THE JavaScript Handler SHALL display error messages in the console IF any required DOM elements are missing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want my settings to save via AJAX without page reload, so that I can quickly test different configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator clicks the save button, THE JavaScript Handler SHALL send settings data via AJAX to the WordPress backend
2. THE JavaScript Handler SHALL disable the save button and display "Saving..." text during the save operation
3. WHEN the save operation completes successfully, THE JavaScript Handler SHALL display a success notification for 3 seconds
4. IF the save operation fails, THE JavaScript Handler SHALL display an error notification and re-enable the save button
5. THE JavaScript Handler SHALL include a WordPress nonce in all AJAX requests for security validation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want the JavaScript file to load properly on the settings page, so that all interactive features function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE MASE Admin Class SHALL enqueue the mase-admin.js file with jQuery and wp-color-picker as dependencies
2. THE MASE Admin Class SHALL enqueue the JavaScript file only on the plugin's admin settings page
3. THE MASE Admin Class SHALL pass the current plugin version as the script version parameter for cache busting
4. THE MASE Admin Class SHALL set the script to load in the footer for optimal page performance
5. WHEN the settings page loads, THE JavaScript Handler SHALL execute its initialization function automatically

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want visual feedback during all interactions, so that I understand when the system is processing my actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator interacts with any slider control, THE JavaScript Handler SHALL update the displayed value immediately
2. WHEN the administrator clicks the save button, THE JavaScript Handler SHALL display a loading indicator
3. WHEN any AJAX operation completes, THE JavaScript Handler SHALL display an appropriate notification message
4. THE JavaScript Handler SHALL apply smooth CSS transitions of 200 milliseconds to all interactive elements
5. THE JavaScript Handler SHALL provide hover states for all clickable elements

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want tab navigation to work smoothly, so that I can access different setting categories efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator clicks any tab, THE JavaScript Handler SHALL switch to the corresponding content panel within 100 milliseconds
2. THE JavaScript Handler SHALL persist the active tab selection in localStorage
3. WHEN the page loads, THE JavaScript Handler SHALL restore the previously active tab from localStorage
4. THE JavaScript Handler SHALL apply visual active states to the current tab
5. THE JavaScript Handler SHALL hide all non-active tab content panels

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive console logging, so that I can debug issues quickly during development and support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE JavaScript Handler SHALL log initialization status on page load
2. THE JavaScript Handler SHALL log all state changes for live preview and dark mode toggles
3. THE JavaScript Handler SHALL log all AJAX request and response data
4. THE JavaScript Handler SHALL log all user interactions with palette and template cards
5. THE JavaScript Handler SHALL log error details with stack traces when exceptions occur

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want live preview to be enabled by default when I open the settings page, so that I can immediately see styling changes without having to manually enable the feature first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Admin Settings Page loads, THE Live Preview System SHALL be enabled by default
2. WHEN the Admin Settings Page loads, THE Live Preview System SHALL set the checkbox to checked state
3. WHEN the Admin Settings Page loads, THE Live Preview System SHALL set aria-checked attribute to "true"

5. THE JavaScript Handler SHALL log the default enabled state to the browser console during initialization

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want the live preview toggle to respond immediately when I click it, so that I can enable or disable live preview without conflicts or race conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE MASE Admin Class SHALL enqueue only one live preview JavaScript file to prevent conflicts
2. THE Admin Settings Page SHALL render dashicons with pointer-events: none to prevent click blocking
