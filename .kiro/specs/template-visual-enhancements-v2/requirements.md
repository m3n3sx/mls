# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines requirements for advanced visual enhancements to the Modern Admin Styler (MASE) WordPress plugin template system. Building upon the existing spectacular template themes, this spec focuses on adding interactive preview capabilities, advanced customization options, theme-specific animations, and enhanced user experience features. All changes are CSS/visual improvements with minimal JavaScript for interactivity.

- **Template Themes**: Pre-designed visual themes (Glass, Gradient, Minimal, Terminal, Gaming, Floral, Professional, Retro)
- **Live Preview**: Real-time preview of template effects before applying
- **Theme Variants**: Alternative color schemes or intensity levels for existing themes
- **Micro-interactions**: Small, subtle animations that provide feedback to user actions
- **Theme Transitions**: Smooth animated transitions when switching between templates
- **Custom Properties**: CSS variables that allow dynamic theme customization
