## Introduction

The Universal Button Styling System extends the Modern Admin Styler (MASE) WordPress plugin to provide comprehensive customization capabilities for all button types throughout the WordPress admin panel. This system enables administrators to define consistent styling for primary, secondary, danger, success, ghost/link buttons, and navigation tabs with granular control over visual properties, states, and effects while maintaining accessibility standards and WordPress compatibility.
