# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Modern Admin Styler Enterprise (MASE) is an enterprise-grade WordPress admin styling plugin designed to provide a clean, maintainable solution for customizing the WordPress admin interface. This version prioritizes simplicity and reliability over feature complexity, learning from the failures of previous iterations (MAS5, MAS7) that suffered from over-engineering and architectural chaos.

The plugin will follow WordPress native patterns, maintain a minimal file structure (maximum 15 files), and use a single JavaScript file without module complexity. It will provide basic styling capabilities through a settings interface while adhering to WordPress coding standards and maintaining high test coverage.
