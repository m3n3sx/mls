**Date:** 2025-10-29 13:00:45
**Branch:** feature/visual-redesign-settings-page

## File Backups Created

- `assets/css/mase-admin.css.backup-20251029-130045` (411K)
- `includes/admin-settings-page.php.backup-20251029-130045` (269K)

## Current File Sizes

### CSS Files
- **mase-admin.css**: 410.4K (420,257 bytes)
  - Status: Current production file
  - Note: Significantly larger than target (150KB uncompressed per requirements)

### PHP Files
- **admin-settings-page.php**: 268.3K (274,696 bytes)
  - Status: Current production file
  - Contains HTML structure for settings page

## Performance Baseline

### File Size Targets (from Requirements 13.1)
- CSS file size: < 150KB uncompressed (153,600 bytes)
- Current CSS: 410.4KB (420,257 bytes)
- **Current vs Target**: 273% of target size
- **Reduction needed**: ~266KB (63.5% reduction required)

### Load Time Targets (from Requirements 13.2)
- Target: < 200ms page load time
- Current: To be measured in browser testing phase

### Animation Performance Targets (from Requirements 13.3, 13.4)
- Target: 60fps for all animations
- Use transform and opacity for GPU acceleration
- Avoid expensive properties (filter, backdrop-filter fallbacks)

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are discovered after deployment:

### Immediate Rollback
```bash
# Restore CSS backup
cp assets/css/mase-admin.css.backup-20251029-130045 assets/css/mase-admin.css

# Restore PHP backup (if modified)
cp includes/admin-settings-page.php.backup-20251029-130045 includes/admin-settings-page.php

# Clear WordPress cache
wp cache flush
```

### Git Rollback
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD

# Or reset to specific commit
git reset --hard <commit-hash>

# Return to main branch
git checkout main
```

### Verification After Rollback
1. Test all functionality
2. Verify visual appearance restored
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Confirm settings save/load correctly

## Notes

- Current CSS file is significantly oversized (411KB vs 150KB target)
- Optimization opportunities exist for file size reduction
- Backup files are timestamped for easy identification
- Git branch created for isolated development
- All backups verified and accessible

## Next Steps

1. Implement design token system (Task 2)
2. Begin component redesign (Tasks 3-12)
3. Monitor file size during development
4. Test performance at each phase
5. Document changes and improvements
