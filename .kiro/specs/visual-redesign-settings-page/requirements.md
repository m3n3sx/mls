# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for a comprehensive visual redesign of the Modern Admin Styler (MASE) plugin settings page. The redesign focuses exclusively on visual improvements—modernizing the interface aesthetics, improving user experience through better visual hierarchy, and enhancing the overall look and feel—without modifying any existing functionality or backend logic.

## Glossary

- **MASE**: Modern Admin Styler - the WordPress plugin being redesigned
- **Settings Page**: The admin interface located at `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=modern-admin-styler` where users configure plugin options
- **Visual Redesign**: Changes to CSS, layout, typography, colors, spacing, and visual elements without altering JavaScript functionality or PHP backend logic
- **Tab Navigation**: The horizontal navigation system that organizes settings into sections (General, Admin Bar, Menu, Content, Typography, Effects, Templates, Advanced)
- **Live Preview**: The existing feature that shows changes in real-time without saving
- **Color Palette**: Pre-defined color schemes that users can apply to their admin interface
- **Template**: Pre-configured sets of settings that users can apply
- **Master Controls**: Global settings that affect the entire admin interface
