# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines requirements for an advanced visual interactive testing system for the Modern Admin Styler (MASE) WordPress plugin. The system will enable automated testing of every plugin option with visual verification in a browser window, allowing testers to see exactly how each setting affects the WordPress admin interface in real-time.

## Glossary

- **MASE**: Modern Admin Styler - the WordPress plugin being tested
- **Test Runner**: The automated system that executes test scenarios
- **Visual Verification**: The ability to see and verify changes in the browser window during test execution
- **Test Scenario**: A specific sequence of actions testing one or more plugin features
- **Interactive Mode**: A testing mode where the tester can pause, inspect, and manually interact with the browser
- **Headless Mode**: A testing mode where tests run without visible browser window (for CI/CD)
- **Test Report**: A comprehensive document showing test results with screenshots and videos
- **WordPress Admin Panel**: The backend administration interface of WordPress (wp-admin)
- **Plugin Settings Page**: The MASE configuration page at wp-admin/admin.php?page=mase-settings
- **Live Preview**: MASE feature that shows changes in real-time without saving
- **Color Palette**: Predefined set of colors that can be applied to the admin interface
- **Template**: Predefined configuration that applies multiple settings at once
