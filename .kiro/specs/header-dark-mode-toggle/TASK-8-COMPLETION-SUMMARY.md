### 2. Automated Tests
The test file includes automated verification for:
- ✓ role="switch" attribute presence
- ✓ aria-checked attribute presence and correctness
- ✓ aria-label attribute presence and descriptiveness
- ✓ Focus capability
- ✓ Decorative icon has aria-hidden="true"

### 3. Bug Fix: Notification Scroll Issue
**Problem**: When enabling dark mode, a gray circle appeared on screen due to scroll animation issues.

**Root Cause**: The `showNotice()` function was attempting to scroll to the notification immediately, but the element wasn't fully rendered, causing animation issues.

**Solution**: Modified `assets/js/mase-admin.js` showNotice function:
- Added `setTimeout` to ensure element is rendered before checking position
- Added viewport visibility check - only scroll if notice is not visible
- Added `.stop()` to prevent animation queuing
- Fixed auto-dismiss to work for all dismissible notices (not just success)

**Changes Made**:
```javascript
// Before: Immediate scroll without checking
$('html, body').animate({
    scrollTop: $notice.offset().top - 50
}, 300);

// After: Delayed scroll with viewport check
setTimeout(function() {
    if ($notice.length && $notice.offset()) {
        var noticeTop = $notice.offset().top;
        var scrollTop = $(window).scrollTop();
        var windowHeight = $(window).height();
        
        // Only scroll if notice is not in viewport
        if (noticeTop < scrollTop || noticeTop > scrollTop + windowHeight) {
            $('html, body').stop().animate({
                scrollTop: noticeTop - 50
            }, 300);
        }
    }
}, 50);
```

4. Verify dark mode enables/disables
5. Press Space again to toggle back
6. Test with Enter key as well

## Verification Results

### Automated Tests (All Passing)
- ✅ Toggle has role="switch"
- ✅ Toggle has aria-checked attribute
- ✅ aria-checked matches checked state
