3. **Touch Targets** - Adequate size for mobile interaction (≥44px)
4. **Text Readability** - Font size meets minimum requirements
5. **Icon Sizing** - Icons scale appropriately for viewport
6. **Layout Overflow** - No horizontal scrolling
7. **Flexbox Alignment** - Proper vertical centering
8. **Responsive Breakpoints** - Correct breakpoint detection
9. **Z-Index** - Proper stacking context (≥99999)
10. **Performance** - Style updates complete in <50ms

#### Visual Verification
- Full-page screenshots for each viewport
- Timestamped for comparison
- Saved to `test-results/responsive/`

#### Data Export
- JSON results with test outcomes
- Viewport information (width, height, DPR)
- Touch support detection
- Orientation data
- Performance metrics

### 5. Documentation

#### Main Documentation (`RESPONSIVE-TESTS-README.md`)

- Validates test helpers
- Confirms documentation exists

#### Run Script (`run-responsive-tests.sh`)
- One-command test execution
- Automatic dependency installation
- Results directory creation
- Organized test execution by category

## Test Execution

## Test Results Location

All test results are saved to:
```
tests/browser-compatibility/test-results/responsive/
```

### Result Files
- `{device}-{test}-{timestamp}.json` - Test results data
- `{device}-{test}-{suffix}-{timestamp}.png` - Screenshots

### Example Files
