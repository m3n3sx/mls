## Screen Reader Testing (5 minutes)

### Quick Test with VoiceOver (macOS)

1. Press **Cmd + F5** to enable VoiceOver
2. Navigate to test file in browser

### What You Should Hear
- Template names clearly announced
- "article" role announced for each card
- Button labels include action and template name
- Active status announced for active template

## Troubleshooting

### Focus Indicators Not Visible
- **Issue**: No blue outline when pressing Tab
- **Solution**: Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **Note**: Some browsers require `:focus-visible` support

### Keyboard Indicator Not Updating
- **Issue**: Top-right indicator shows "None"
- **Solution**: Click inside the page first, then press Tab
- **Note**: Page must have focus for keyboard events

### ARIA Results Show Failures
- **Issue**: Red ✗ marks in ARIA validation
- **Solution**: This indicates missing attributes in the test HTML
- **Note**: Check browser console for details

### Screen Reader Not Announcing
- **Issue**: Screen reader is silent
- **Solution**: 
  1. Verify screen reader is running
  2. Check audio is not muted
  3. Try navigating with arrow keys
  4. Restart screen reader if needed

3. **Test Navigation**
   - Press Tab to move through template cards
   - Verify focus indicators appear
   - Press Enter on a card to activate Apply button
