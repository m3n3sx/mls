## Optimization Strategy

### 20.1 Selector Optimization
- ✅ Maximum nesting depth: 3 levels (verified)
- ✅ Efficient selectors used throughout
- ✅ No overly complex selectors found
- ⚠️ Some duplicate rules identified for consolidation

### 20.2 Performance Optimization
- ⚠️ Excessive use of box-shadow (needs optimization)
- ⚠️ will-change used sparingly (good, but can be optimized)

- ✅ CSS containment not needed for current structure

### 20.3 CSS Validation
- ✅ All CSS variables defined in :root
- ✅ Fallback values provided
- ✅ Browser compatibility maintained
