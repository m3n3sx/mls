## Monitoring Tools

### Automated Monitoring

```bash
# Start continuous monitoring
./scripts/monitor-deployment.sh --monitor

# Check current status
./scripts/monitor-deployment.sh --status

# Generate report
./scripts/monitor-deployment.sh --report
```

### Manual Checks

**Daily Checks** (First week):
- [ ] Review error logs
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Monitor user feedback
- [ ] Verify feature adoption

**Weekly Checks** (First month):
- [ ] Analyze error trends
- [ ] Review performance data
- [ ] Assess feature usage
- [ ] Plan next rollout phase

**Monthly Checks** (Ongoing):
- [ ] Comprehensive audit
- [ ] User satisfaction survey
- [ ] Technical debt review
- [ ] Plan improvements

### Log Locations

```bash
# WordPress debug log
tail -f wp-content/debug.log

# PHP error log
tail -f /var/log/php/error.log

# Web server error log
tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log  # or apache2/error.log

# MASE-specific logs
grep "MASE" wp-content/debug.log | tail -100
```

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Count errors in last hour
grep "$(date -d '1 hour ago' '+%Y-%m-%d %H')" wp-content/debug.log | grep -c "ERROR"

# Find most common errors
grep "ERROR" wp-content/debug.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10

# Check feature flag status
wp option get mase_feature_flags --format=json

# Check rollout percentages
wp option get mase_feature_rollout_percentages --format=json

# Clear all caches
wp cache flush && wp transient delete --all
```

## Rollback Decision Matrix

### Automatic Rollback Triggers

The monitoring script will automatically trigger rollback if:

1. **Error Rate > 5%** for any feature
2. **Critical Errors > 0** in last 5 minutes
3. **Performance Degradation > 20%** from baseline
4. **Multiple User Complaints** (> 5 in 1 hour)

### Manual Rollback Triggers

Consider manual rollback if:

1. **Data Integrity Issues**: Settings not persisting correctly
2. **Security Concerns**: Potential vulnerability discovered
3. **Widespread Impact**: Issue affects > 50% of users
4. **Cascading Failures**: One issue causing multiple problems

### Rollback Procedure

```bash
# Quick rollback
./scripts/monitor-deployment.sh --rollback "Reason for rollback"

# Manual rollback steps
# 1. Disable feature flags
wp option update mase_feature_flags '{
    "modern_preview_engine": false,
    "modern_state_manager": false,
    "modern_api_client": false,
    "legacy_fallback": true
}' --format=json

# 2. Clear caches
wp cache flush
wp transient delete --all

# 3. Restore backup if needed
tar -xzf backups/mase-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.tar.gz -C wp-content/plugins/

# 4. Verify legacy functionality
# - Test color changes
# - Test template application
# - Test settings save/load

# 5. Notify users
# - Update status page
# - Send notification
# - Provide ETA for fix
```
