### MASE-ACC-001: Live Preview aria-checked Synchronization

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `aria-checked` attribute synchronization to toggle handler

**Files Modified:**

   - Runs on every build

2. **aria-checked Synchronization Test** (`tests/visual-testing/aria-checked-test.js`)
   - Verifies both Live Preview and Dark Mode toggles
   - Tests enable/disable state changes
   - Confirms proper attribute values

3. **Accessibility Audit Test** (`tests/accessibility/axe-audit-test.js`)
   - Runs axe-core on entire settings page
   - Tests both Light and Dark modes
   - Generates detailed accessibility reports
