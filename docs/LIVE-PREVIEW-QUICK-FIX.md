## The Problem

Live preview toggle not working due to duplicate implementation file in codebase.

---

## The Solution

Delete one file. That's it.

```bash
rm assets/js/mase-admin-live-preview.js
```

---

## Why This Works

- File is NOT currently loaded (verified)
- No code references it (verified)
- It's dead code from old refactor
- Removing it eliminates potential conflicts

```bash
cd wp-content/plugins/modern-admin-styler/
